Hi there,<br><br>
my name is Felix. I'm a software engineer from Germany who is passionate about building software which is simple, 
straightforward and useful for solving a specific problem. Also I'm highly interested in creating new sources of 
knowledge for those who haven't been in touch with the topic of software creation and would like to learn something about it.<br><br>
Right now I'm working on two projects which I'd like to turn into actual products within the next months. One being a 
java based database migration tool. My second project is a low-threshold programming course which contains fundamentals of 
programming, software engineering and creating and deploying your first application.<br><br>
