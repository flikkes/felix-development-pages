Felix-db-migration-tool is a java based tool for easily migrating data from one database to another.
In the current version I try to offer a simple API especially for encapsulating data reads and writes from and to a
MySQL database. <br><br>
My goal is to provide a simple and efficient converting mechanism from database
specific formats into a generic format while covering a large variety of database systems.
In the current version only MySQL and MongoDB are supported. My plan is to enhance functionality and gradually increase
the number of supported
database systems. <br><br>
While the standard open source version will continue to receive important updates I'll start to develop an
advanced version of the software which will be available soon. This Version will include advanced functionality,
stable and experimental API and other special features. <br><br>
If you have any questions or want to suggest something
I should include in future updates, feel free to contact me at <a
